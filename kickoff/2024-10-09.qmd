## MUD cards

* questions about getting lecture notes before class and/or solutions in `after_lecture` -- all of this is posted. if you aren't sure how to get them, ask a peer.
    
* questions about git -- at the moment, continue to muddle through. Will have a lecture and a problem set on this later in the course.

* PG remark on professionalism: be on time. it is particularly awkward to get mud cards saying that something is unclear from someone who was late and missed the part of class where some material is covered. 

## Sumner "Why are we switching to VSCode?"

Joaquin (TA): "It's much much better"

Some strengths we have noticed

* Software of choice for developing in many languages (not just Python)
* Supports `qmd`
* Elegant integration with `git` and virtual environments (coming soon)
* Github Copilot (discouraged for this course, but super useful down the road)

## Knitting to pdf I

We finally have a solution for this! (also MUD) Can see Peter's issue ticket *[here](https://github.com/vega/vl-convert/issues/183)*

**1. terminal**
```{}
pip install vl-convert-python --upgrade
```

**2. python kernel**
```{python}
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable("png")
```

**3. qmd header**
```{}

## Knitting to pdf II

Five instructors tested this solution on a variety of machines (thank you!!!). 

* Only run `alt.renderers.enable("png")` if you want to make `.pdf`. If you want to make `.html`, no need to include this (and it might lead to errors)
* One also found that they needed to run `pip install ipykernel`

As usual, we don't know what will work on your computer, so please report bugs and issues!

## Announcements on homepage

* minilesson recordings on homepage. Will continue to record but will not send separate announcements
* Upcoming career panels on Nov 8 and Nov 15. RSVP link on homepage.

## Debrief (TBD)
